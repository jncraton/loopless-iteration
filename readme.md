Loopless Iteration
==================

You will create a program that outputs all squares less than or equal to `n` where `n` is an integer argument passed to the program. For example:

```bash
./squares 400
```

```
1
4
9
16
25
36
49
64
81
100
121
144
169
196
225
256
289
324
361
400
```

For the purpose of this assignment, you must do this without using loops (for, while, etc) or recursion. You may not create any functions outside of `main`. The only control flow statements you should need are `if` and `goto`.
